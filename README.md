# Phishing Punisher
I often receive phishing messages with a fake Facebook login form. This Python script generates and submits thousands of fake login infos to those phishing sites.

## How to use
1. Download source code.
2. Change the url inside `stress.py`.
3. Run `stress.py`.
4. You can also run this script on cloud services for greater impact.
